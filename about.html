      <h1>About this Website</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>This is a small website that could be used as a break sign. It will let clients know how long you will be away from you desk.</p>
      <p>I initally made it to be used at a previous employer. I would come back from a break and clients would be waiting. These clients were analysts for a well known investing company. I was hoping it would help them manage their time.</p>
      <p>This website uses nodejs, html, css, and javascript. You can see the source code on my github (<a href="https://github.com/jvillega/Break-Sign">https://github.com/jvillega/Break-Sign</a>).</p>
      <p>There a couple of things I would add and change. I'm not completely pleased with how page navigation works. I would prefer to implement some kind of drop down menu for the navigation. A feature that displays an image once the timer is up would be something I would want to implement. I though it might be fun if the images that are displayed are funny or embarissing. They would be safe work pictures of myself. It was ultimately made to be as simple as possible. Those are just a couple of ideas I had.</p>
